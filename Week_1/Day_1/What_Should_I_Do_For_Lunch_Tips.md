### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the 'node command in your terminal

work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces.

To  help you figure out how to use `hungry1 and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the terminal as follows

```javascript
const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
